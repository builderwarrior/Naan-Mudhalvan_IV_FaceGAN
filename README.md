# Naan Mudhalvan Project: Facial Image Synthesis with DCGAN

## Problem Statement
In medical training and simulation, the availability of diverse and realistic patient scenarios for trainees is limited. Traditional methods often lack accuracy in representing various patient demographics, conditions, and emotional states encountered in clinical practice.

## Objectives
- Develop a DCGAN architecture optimized for realistic facial image synthesis.
- Train the model on diverse facial datasets to ensure accurate representation.
- Evaluate the model's performance for realism and applicability in various domains.

## Existing Methods
- Traditional generative models struggle to produce highly realistic facial images.
- Rule-based systems face complexity in capturing variability of human faces.
- Style transfer methods may encounter difficulties in maintaining consistency in facial features.
- GAN variants may suffer from training instability issues.
- Accessing large, diverse, and high-quality facial image datasets for training can be challenging.

## Proposed Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Utilize the CelebA dataset for training the DCGAN model.
2. **Generator Network**: Upsample random noise vectors to generate synthetic images.
3. **Discriminator Network**: Evaluate the authenticity of generated images.
4. **Adversarial Training**: Train the generator and discriminator networks in an adversarial manner.
5. **Training Process**: Update network parameters iteratively using real and synthetic images.
6. **Evaluation**: Quantitative metrics (e.g., FID score) and qualitative assessments are used to evaluate model performance.
7. **Image Generation**: Use the trained generator network to generate synthetic facial images for various applications.
